# Advanced Architecting

## Day 1

### Module 0: Architecting on AWS - Review

### Building systems on AWS: Ten Best Practices

1. Enable scalability
 - Ensure that your architecture can handle changes in demand.

2. Automate your environment
 - Where possible, automate the provisioning, termination, and configuration of resources.

3. Use disposable resources
 - Take advantage of the dynamically provisioned nature of cloud computing.

4. Loosely couple components
 - Design architectures with independent components.

5. Design services, not servers
 - Leverage the breadth of AWS services; don't limit your infrasturure to servers.

6. Choose the right database solutions
 - Match technology to a workload, not the other way around.

7. Avoid single points of failure
 - Assume everything fails then design backward.

8. Optimize for cost
 - Take advantage of AWS's flexibility platform to increase your cost efficiency.

9. Use caching
 - Caching minimizes redundant data retrieval operations, improving performance and cost.

10. Secure your entire infrastructure
 - Build security into every layer of your infrastructure
